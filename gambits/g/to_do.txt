- RANGE

- cta(false) after a reaction is picked will stop the player from taking
  any further action if it attempts the reaction on someone that is out
  of range; no attempt to cast the spell is made, so the success/interupt
  packet never comes to set cta to true.
  Also for command errors. Probably for /ITEM when don't have item as well.

- READYING may not respond if the ID sent by XI for a move isn't
  the one gambits expects. In resources, there are multiple IDs
  associated with Bubble Curtain, but the resource table only
  has a single entry (443) with the other entries commented out.
  If it's 1590, 3473, or 3862 (other IDs associated with Bubble Curtain),
  Gambits will not trigger "ENEMY","READYING","Bubble Curtain"
  Note: I have yet to actually see this happen.

- Selectors for specific players (PLAYER_NAME "Jacki")

- local gambits_to_check, num_gambits for every single check_gambit_list() call.
  Need to make it so gambits_to_check and num_gambits are global; updated when
  the current target changes. Then can just make all calls check_gambit_list().

- Freaks the hell out in alliance situations

- Specific job selectors. {"MAGE","NOT_STATUS","Hailstorm"} gives the BLU hailstorm.

- Come up with something to distinguish Melees from Ranged

- Maybe redo the way checks work, do all checks for all gambits at once (so we only
  step through everyone once), then select the highest priority condition. At the
  moment, checks are #G^2 * #P, when they could be #G * #P.

- I may have broken AND at some point in time?
  {"AND",{{"PARTY","STATUS","Sleep"},{"PARTY","NOT_STATUS","Charm"}},"","MA","Cure"}
  Throws errors.

- WS properties for certain Trust NPCs

- When Trust NPCs have their WS properties fleshed out, re-enable CAN_SC

- Waiting on action packet is starting to be limiting, will need to implement sleep cycles

- Job selection does not work for Trusts.

- "PET HP <" (Automatic Full Circle when luopan is low)

- NOT_ASSISTING, ASSIST: Safety check to make sure provided player is in zone, party, alive

- "BEHIND" (for "AND: {"BEHIND", "TP >= 1000", "JA_READY Sneak Attack"}" >> Sneak Attack -> Rudra's)

- Trying to cast on dead pt members and killed trusts

- Somehow hung gambits when moving the buff bitmask stuff to the
  beginning of the player_i loop instead of at the bottom.

- Bug with running out of player_i (and hence buffs and buff bitmask)
  once our player_id is greater than 5 (since the assignments happen
  at the end of the loop after increasing player_i by one). Occurs
  when party is full of real people, and won't be noticed with
  less than 6 people (because trusts aren't in the party buff packet,
  and the loop terminiates when it gets to an empty slot (before 5))
  (Note: Temporarily fixed with an if check which shouldn't
         be neccessary.)
