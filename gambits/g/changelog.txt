0.15.3 - (2019/06/10)
======================
- Added capability to have custom gambits defined per character
  If character.lua is defined in the /my_gambits/ folder, it will
  check that lua for your current job. If gambits are found it will
  use those, if not, Gambits will use the gambits in the my_gambits.lua
  as per usual

- Added in some movement checks, so that gambits finally stops trying
  to constantly cast spells when you're moving, even when engaged_only
  is off

0.15.2 - (2017/09/17)
======================
- Added the capability to toggle claim checks with //g cc.
  Only use this to disable claim checks in special situations you
  know you need to, and remember to renable them when you're done!

0.15.1 - (2017/09/16)
======================
- Stopped Gambits from trying to cast on untargettable sphere trusts

- Added the new Indicolure buff to resources, allowing Gambits
  to use enfeebling bubbles (!)

0.15.0 - (2016/10/05)
======================
- Added various PUP maneuver related SELF triggers:
  {"SELF", "FIRE_MANEUVERS <", 2, "JA", "Fire Maneuver"}
  {"SELF", "MANEUVERS <", 3, "JA", "Wind Maneuver"}

- Added PET_HPP <=
  {"SELF", "PET_HPP <=", 50, "JA", "Light Maneuver"}

- Added PET_IDLE, which fires if a pet isn't engaged
  when the gambit list is checked
  {"SELF", "PET_IDLE", "", "JA", "Deploy"}


0.14.1 - (2016/04/12)
======================
- Added a command to toggle engaged_only on/off.
  Command: //g eo

- Buffs/debuffs now work correctly when you have
  more than 16 status effects.

- Added a cta ticket system. If for some reason cta
  is still false after the maximum casting time for
  a spell, and that spell was the last action gambits
  tried to perform, cta will be set to true. This
  gets around any weird cases where an action fails
  without any existing indication that it did
  (Ie: Your target dying midcast; XI doesn't send
       out a message that your spellcasting failed
       in this case.)

- NOT_STATUS now ignores trusts. No more spamming
  Haste on a Trust we can't see buff information for!

- Prevented gambits from analyzing dead party members.
  No more getting stuck trying to cure dead people!

0.14.0 - (2016/04/08)
======================
- Added CHAIN reaction. This a complex reaction
  type which allows you to link multiple actions
  in a row in response to a single trigger activation.
  Useful for using SCH abilities to make sure everyone
  has a certain buff!

  To use, have the reaction be "CHAIN", while the r_arg
  as an ARRAY of reactions you want to link.

  Example:
  {"SELF","NOT_STATUS","Hailstorm","CHAIN",{
                                            {"JA","Perpetuance"},
                                            {"JA","Accession"},
                                            {"MA","Hailstorm"}
                                           }}

  Works with Clusters too:
  {"CLUSTER","NOT_STATUS","Regen","CHAIN",{
                                           {"JA","Accession"},
                                           {"MA","Regen IV"}
                                          }}

  Just remember Gambit's inherent fall-through nature and try
  to use that first if possible. For example, SA + WS could
  already be achieved by using two consecutive gambits like so:
  {"AND",
         {{"SELF","TP >=", 1000},
         {"SELF","NOT_STATUS", "Sneak Attack"}},"JA","Sneak Attack"}
  {"SELF","TP >=",1000,"WS","Rudra's Storm"}

- Added NOT_TAGGED. Can be used to make sure you
  have hate on the enemy at the start of a fight!
  Ex: {"ENEMY","NOT_TAGGED","","MA","Dia II"}

- Fixed ENEMY READYING and CASTING, which had
  apparently been broken since version 0.11.0 when
  distance checks were added.

- Fixed ability_ready() not properly recognizing
  that a stratagem charge was available if one had
  already been used when another was available.

0.13.3 - (2016/04/07)
======================
- Fixed ATTACK and ASSIST flagging cta(true) when
  the character is actually able to take actions

- Fixed automatically running off after killing a mob
  that had been ATTACKed and was being /followed.

0.13.2 - (2016/04/02)
======================
- Gambits should no longer attempt to react when
  the character is unable to act, which should
  prevent cta(false) bugs.

- Gambits now makes sure the player isn't suffering
  from Mute when checking to see if a spell is available.
  Hat Tip: Jacki for pointing this out.

0.13.1 - (2016/03/12)
======================
- Gambits now checks the gambit list when a spell
  or job ability becomes available for recast, 
  even if no new action packets have come in.

0.13.0 - (2016/03/04)
======================
- Added "MPP <=" trigger. Fires when the target has
  less than the stated percentage of MP remaining.

- Added "NO_PET" trigger. Works with SELF. No trigger_arg.
  Fires when the player doesn't currently have a pet.
  Example: {"SELF","NO_PET","","MA","Geo-Regen"}

- Gambits now has its own english-name-keyed resource
  tables, and now longer has to flip the base Windower
  tables on load. This has changed Gambits from temporarily
  freezing the window (lots of item IDs) on load/reload,
  to loading nigh-instaneously!

  Hat Tip: tkm256 for making a key-flipper for me to use!

- Because Gambits now has its own resource tables, it can
  have its own keys for buffs that would normally not be
  included in the key-flipped table. This means that all
  Geomancy-related buffs now have their own keys, and
  Gambits can finally be used for Geo Buffs!
  Example: {"SELF","NOT_STATUS","Geo Haste","MA","Indi-Haste"}
 

0.12.0  - (2016/02/27)
======================
- Added "TANK", "MELEE", "RANGED", and "MAGE" selectors.
  Targets party members whose current job qualifies as
  the selecting type.
  Note 1: Does not work for Trusts.

- No longer attempts to cast on party members who
  are out of spellcasting range.

- Now refreshes party list as the party changes without
  needing to hard reload when someone joins or a Trust
  is summoned.

- No longer remembers trusts who were released or died.

0.11.1  - (2016/02/26)
======================
- can_take_action is now action packet based instead
  of being on a calculated timer. Results in quickest
  possible spellcasting spam, regardless of casting
  faster than the base default spellcasting time.

0.11.0  - (2016/02/16)
======================
- Added "CLUSTER" selector. Will return the party member
  who is within beneficial AoE range (9.9') of the most 
  party members satisfying the condition.
  Ex: {"CLUSTER","HPP <=",80,"MA","Curaga III"}
  Note: At least 3 people in a given cluster must
        satisfy the condition for the cluster to be
        eligible for selection.

0.10.0  - (2016/01/29)
======================
- Gambits now has perfect knowledge of the statuses of
  party members (who are currently in the same zone).
  NOTE: This only applies to real party members that
        FFXI sends out a party_buff packet for. Since
        the server does not send out said packet for
        Trusts in the party, Gambits has NO knowledge
        of the statuses of Trust members other than
        their HP, MP, and TP. This will probably result
        in endless buffing loops if you use 
        ("PARTY","NOT_STATUS") while a Trust is summoned.

0.9.0   - (2015/10/13)
======================
- Added a engaged_only flag. This is hard-set in g.lua
  itself. Will cause Gambits to only perform actions
  while you yourself are engaged in combat. This prevents
  you from trying to buff yourself while you're running
  around inside Salvage, for example.

- Fixed attempting to cast a spell you lack the MP for.

0.8.0   - (2015/08/09)
======================
- Added "ENEMY" selector.

- Added "READYING" and "CASTING" triggers. These can be
  used with the ENEMY selector to trigger a reaction
  if the mob is trying to use a given TP move or spell.
  Or: Added stunning.

- Added "CAN_SC" trigger. Combines with SELF. Fires when
  the enemy has a current skillchain property applied to it 
  that can be used to make the given trigger_arg. Does /not/
  determine a weaponskill (if you have any) that can be used
  to actually make the skillchain. The reaction will be
  whatever you give it ("WS","Shark Bite") regardless of
  whether or not it can make the SC ("SELF","CAN_SC","Light").

- Fixed not being able to load gambits unless the current
  Main Job had special mob tactics defined in all tactics files.

0.7.0   - (2015/06/28)
======================
- Added "AND" 'selector'. This is a complex selector that
  can be used to check against multiple triggers at once.
  The syntax is slightly different: the selector value is
  "AND", while the trigger is an array of triggers. The
  (base) trigger argument isn't used, and can/should be
  left blank. Each child trigger inside the combined 
  triggers array must consist of a valid selector, trigger, 
  and trigger_arg.

  Example: {"AND",{
                   {"SELF","TP >=",1000},
                   {"SELF","HPP >","65"}
                  },
                  "",
                  "WS",
                  "Rudra's Storm"}
  Would use Rudra's Storm, but only when you have more than
  65% of your HP.

  Note: YOU DO NOT NEED TO - AND SHOULDN'T - USE THIS TO MAKE
  SURE YOU MEET CONDITIONS TO USE YOUR STATED REACTION.
  Gambits automatically checks to see if you can use the
  given reaction. In other words,
  
  Bad: {"AND",{
               {"SELF","HPP <=",70},
               {"SELF","TP >=",500}
              },
              "",
              "JA",
              "Curing Waltz III"}
  Good: {"SELF","HPP <=",70,"JA","Curing Waltz III"}

  The check to see if you have enough TP is implicitly
  performed by the "JA" reaction. AND is meant for use
  with unrelated child triggers.

- Added the ability to use special gambits for a specific
  enemy you're fighting. These work almost exactly like
  regular gambits, but are instead placed within the
  'tactics' folder, and given the name of the mob you
  want them used for. See "tactics/Blanched Mandragora.lua"
  for an example.

  IMPORTANT: When you create a new set of tactics for
  a mob, you must edit "tactics/tactics_list.txt" and 
  insert the mob's name in it on its own line. The only 
  special tactics that get loaded/checked are those whose 
  names are lised in the text document!

- Added "ITEM" reaction. Attempts to use an item
  provided the trigger is satisfied, and the item is
  either in the player's inventory or temp items.
  Example: {"SELF","STATUS","Silenced","ITEM","Echo Drops"}
  Note: Will always do /item 'name' <me>. Can't attempt to
  use items on other entities at this time.

- Added "SHADOWs <", "MOVES <", and "MOVES >=". Triggers
  when you have less than X shadows, less than X finishing
  moves, and greater than/equal to X finishing moves.

- Added "HPP >" trigger. Fires when the target has
  more than reaction_arg percentage of HP.

- Fixed attempting to use job abilities that require TP
  when the player didn't have the requisite amount.

- Added functionality for english->id translation to use
  either en or enl for buff names/ids. So now you can use
  either "Paralysis" or "Paralyzed" for the Paralyze status 
  effect.

0.6.0   - (2015/06/17)
======================

- Gambits can/must now be written in mostly plain-english.
  Example: {"PARTY","STATUS","Poison","MA","Poisona"}
  No more having to look up buff/spell/ja IDs! On load, they'll
  be processed and convert into their "true" form. You'll be
  yelled at if you enter in a buff/ability name that it was
  unable to look up.
  [Note: Geomancy spells are now broken until I come up with some
  way to work around them bestowing the same buff name as
  generic boosts. (Ie: "Refresh" refers to both ID 43, and
  the ID 541 that a Indi-Refresh check would require.)]

- Added "NOT_ENGAGED" trigger. Fires when the player is
  not currently in the engaged status (weapon out).

- Added "ATTACK" reaction. If you're targetting a monster when
  the trigger is fired, will lock on to target, /follow, and /a.

- Added "NOT_ASSISTING" trigger. Fires when the player is not
  currently targetting the same mob as the provided player name.

- Added "ASSIST" reaction. /assists a player who's "NOT_ASSISTING"
  check you just failed against.

- Enemy-only abilities/spells will no longer try to fire
  when player isn't targetting an enemy. Additionally, they'll
  only fire when the mob has been claimed by the pt. No more
  auto-firing Thunder IVs at innocent crabs while trying to
  tab around to target the mean pugil.

0.5.0   - (2015/06/03)
======================

- Now automatically selects gambits for the current main_job

- Keybind for Ctrl+G to quickly disable/reenable

- Added "PARTY" selector. Returns the first party member that
  satisfies the given trigger.

- Added trigger "MA_READY". Can be used to auto-nuke.
  Note: Only works with "SELF" selector.

- Added trigger "JA_READY".
  Note 1: Only works with "SELF" selector.
  Note 2: For buff-bestowing abilities, you should continue to 
  use {NOT_STATUS, BUFF_ID, JA}. Using "JA_READY" by itself will 
  result in using the ability the second it's up, even if you already 
  possess the buff. JA_READY is meant for enemy-targeting abilities 
  like Provoke, not Haste Samba.

- Added trigger "STATUS".
  Note 1: While I make my best attempt at tracking statues for other
  party members, do not rely on this to be accurate for anyone other
  than the player character ("SELF").
  Note 2: Many TP moves don't send out any sort of message that a given 
  status effect has been applied. The server will send out notices for 
  some of the statuses the move inflicts, but not necessarily all of them.
  The gambiteer will be oblivious to such unreported ailments.

- Reactions are now blocked for the full duration of a spell's casting.
  (Ie: Not trying to cast Spell B before you're finished with Spell A)
  Note: This blocking time is for the default casting time of a spell. Gear
  or abilities that reduce spell-casting time are /not/ taken into account.
