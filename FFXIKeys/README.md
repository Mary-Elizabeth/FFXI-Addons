A small windower addon to automate trading keys for rewards

Action                | Addon Command

Aliases:

Action                | Addon Command
--------------------- | -----------------------------
Use SP Gobbie Key     | //usekeys

\<key\> should be replaced with values from [data/keys.lua](https://github.com/Tny5989/FFXIKeys/blob/master/data/keys.lua).  
\<count\> should be replaced with a number.

This addon does not check your accolades.  It is up to you to verify your accolades amount before buying keys.  

As with all my addons, this is still a work in progress and should be used at your own risk.
