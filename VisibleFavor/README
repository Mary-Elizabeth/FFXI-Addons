The addon will display a Geomancy bubble around your avatar so that it's
possible to see the area of effect of your Avatar's Favor and Blood
Pact: Wards. Unfortunately the Geomancy bubble visuals a slightly
smaller then Favor/Ward ranges (9 yalms vs 10 yalms) but it's close
enough to still be helpful.

The available commands are:
    vf toggle/on/off
        Toggles, enabled or disables the effects.
    vf display all/self/favor
        Sets the conditions in which the bubbles will be displayed.
        all = Display for all player's avatars, all the time.
        self = Display only for your avatar, all the time.
        favor = Display only for your avatar, when Avatar's Favor is active.
    vf effect buff/debuff
        Sets the type of Geomancy bubble visual to use.
        buff = Use the visual effect of enhancing Geomancy.
        debuff = Use the visual effect of enfeebling Geomancy.
